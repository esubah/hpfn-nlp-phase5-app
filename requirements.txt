# Common utilities often pulled in:
attrs==25.3.0
MarkupSafe==3.0.2  # For Jinja2
platformdirs==4.3.8 # Common utility for finding platform-specific dirs

# Things like `jsonschema` and its dependencies (`referencing`, `rpds-py`, `jsonschema-specifications`)
# are often pulled in by `altair` or `pydeck`. If `altair` and `pydeck` are included,
# pip should handle these. We can try deploying without explicitly listing them first.
# If the build fails missing them, we add them. This keeps the initial list cleaner.
